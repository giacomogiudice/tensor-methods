\begin{section}{Area Law for the Toric Code}
Consider an area $A$ of the toric code ground state $\ket{\Psi}$.
Notice that all the loop configurations intersect $\partial A$ an even number of times. 
Why is that?
We shall call the configurations of highlighted links crossing $\partial A$ a \emph{boundary pattern}.
Show that, for a given $A$,  the number of loop configurations in the interior of $A$ is independent of the boundary pattern.

We can write a Schmidt decomposition $\ket{\Psi} = \sum_i \lambda_i \ket{\alpha_i} \ket{\beta_i}$, with states $\ket{\alpha_i}$ belonging to $A$ and $\ket{\beta_i}$ belonging to $\bar{A}$.
Prove that, in this case,
\[
   \ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathcal{N}_B}}\sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{N}_B} \ket{\alpha_i} \ket{\beta_i},
\]
where $\mathcal{N}_B$ is the number of boundary patterns.
How much is $\mathcal{N}_B$?
Conclude by showing that the entanglement is $S_A = |\partial A| - 1$.
What is the topological correction to the area law for the toric code?

\note{Hint} Compute many loops can you construct on a generic area of the lattice by repeatedly applying the plaquette operator.
\end{section}

\begin{section}{The Toric Code as a PEPS}
Recall the construction of the toric code ground state using the tensor below
\[
  A^{i_1,i_2,i_3,i_4}_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta}
  = 
  {
    \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=0]
      \node[mps,minimum size=6*\tu] (t) {};
      \draw[index] (t.north) -- +(0,\tu) node[left]{$\alpha$};
      \draw[index] (t.east) -- +(\tu,0) node[above]{$\beta$};
      \draw[index] (t.south) -- +(0,-\tu) node[right]{$\gamma$};
      \draw[index] (t.west) -- +(-\tu,0) node[below]{$\delta$};
      \draw[index] (t.north) -- (t.east) node[site,midway]{} node[midway,left]{$i_1$};
      \draw[index] (t.east) -- (t.south) node[site,midway]{} node[midway,above]{$i_2$};
      \draw[index] (t.south) -- (t.west) node[site,midway]{} node[midway,right]{$i_3$};
      \draw[index] (t.west) -- (t.north) node[site,midway]{} node[midway,below]{$i_4$};
    \end{tikzpicture} 
  }
  = 
  \begin{cases}
    \alpha=i_4 \oplus i_1\\
    \beta=i_1 \oplus i_2\\
    \gamma=i_2 \oplus i_3\\
    \delta=i_3 \oplus i_4\\
  \end{cases} ,
\]
where $\oplus$ is the logical XOR operation, i.e. addition modulo 2.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item List all the configurations that give rise to a non-zero entry of $A$.
Do this by graphically highlighting the physical and virtual links associated to the index 1. 
You should obtain 16 distinct configurations.
\item What is the action of $X$ from a physical leg to the virtual legs? 
What about a pair of $X$s or $Z$s on different physical legs?
\item Check that the tensor $A$ is $\mathrm{Z}_2$-invariant on the virtual level.
\item Show the symmetries of the toric code $A_v \ket{\Psi} = \ket{\Psi}$ and $B_p \ket{\Psi} = \ket{\Psi}$ using the tensor.
\item How do the string operators $W_l^{(e)}$ and $W_{l^*}^{(m)}$ (see previous homework) act on the tensors?
What are the endpoint tensors and how do they transform under the $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry?
What about closed loops?
\item Prove that the contraction of all these different tensors gives rise to all loop configurations, with the same weight.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{section}{The Toric Code on the Honeycomb Lattice*}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/torus.png}}
\end{figure}
Consider a honeycomb lattice on a torus, with a qubit on each edge.
As for the square lattice, we define a toric code Hamiltonian for this lattice.
How many degenerate ground states do you expect?
We will now derive the physics of this model, in a similar fashion to the square lattice case.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Write down the vertex and plaquette operators, in terms of the Pauli matrices, using the same convention used during the lectures.
 Denote the ($-1$)-eigenstate of $Z$ by a highlighted edge.
What are all the 1-eigenstates of the vertex term?
\item Formulate the ground space as a sum over loop configurations. 
What additional properties do these loop configurations have, compared to the square lattice case?
\item Construct a tensor network associated to this ground state. 
Construct a copy of each site by adding an ancillary state $\ket{0}$ to each edge and applying a CNOT gate on the pair.
We can then construct a tensor $A^{i_1,i_2,i_3}_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}$ for three sites around each vertex.
Which configurations give rise to a non-zero entry to the tensor?
\item Check that this tensor has a purely virtual $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry.
\item So far we have been a bit generic on the boundary conditions.
Consider the two polygons below, where each boundary is glued to its matching one. 
What surfaces do these constructions generate? 
Are they topologically equivalent?

  }
\end{figure}
\item Can we cover these surfaces with a honeycomb lattice? 
If so, what is the degeneracy of the ground state of the toric code on each surface?
