# Quantum Information Methods in Many-Body Physics 

## Welcome
Here you can find the exercises for the course [Quantum Information Methods in Many-Body Physics](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/org/cc/mh/PH2269/) at __TUM__.
I try to post the exercises on Monday, the solutions are usually posted the following week.

## References
Here are some suggested reviews and books that cover the broad subjects.
Some more specific papers are mentioned in the exercises and solutions.
